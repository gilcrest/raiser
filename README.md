## raiser ##

**raiser** is a PL/SQL error manager.  **raiser** leverages the very feature rich functionality being developed as part of OraOpenSource's [logger](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger "logger") utility through logger's plugin facility built into logger versions 3.0.0 and above.

There are other PL/SQL managers in circulation today (Quest Error Manager, etc.), but they do not seem to be under active development.
